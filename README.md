Welcome to our project repository. This project is centered on estimating the food demand system for children aged 4-13 in Uganda, targeting the primary school age demographic. By linking food demand with nutritional Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs), our aim is to uncover and address nutrient deficiencies affecting these children. Our main objective is to develop a comprehensive nutrient system that identifies dietary gaps and investigates possible policy interventions to alleviate these issues.

In terms of policy evaluation, we are looking into two main strategies: Conditional Cash Transfer programs and School Lunch programs. For the cash transfer simulation, we add a flat $300 to household food expenditures under the assumption that this increase is spent entirely on food. This approach allows us to analyze how such financial enhancements influence dietary choices and nutritional intake. Additionally, we are implementing a "School Meal Box" strategy, which includes a set of commonly purchased foods such as Cassava, Fish, Maize, Oranges, Rice, and Sweet Potato. This is intended to reflect a practical meal offering that could be provided in schools.

Through this project, we will quantify the shifts in food expenditures and assess their impact on nutritional adequacy, with a particular focus on essential nutrients like Vitamin C. By comparing the nutritional outcomes of these policy interventions with a control scenario, we aim to provide actionable insights into which measures are most effective at improving child nutrition in Uganda
